    <p> Making burgers and fries at home is nothing new, but what if you 
        could recreate the burgers and fries that are headed 
        towards cult status? I'm talking about Five Guys. 
        With 1000+ locations in the U.S. and around the world — and with 
        many more on the way — Five Guys is fast becoming an 
        international fast food favorite. Nicole McLaughlin, 
        aka NicoleMcmom, has cracked the code for the burgers and fries 
        she loves so much from Five Guys, and she's here to show you 
        how you can make them, too. Watch the video up top, 
        then scroll down to get her copycat recipe plus how-to tips

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>2 medium russet potatoes</li>
            <li>8 cups peanut oil for frying</li>
            <li>14 ounces ground chuck</li>
            <li>4 thick slices American cheese</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon hot sauce (such as Frank's Red Hot)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon mayonnaise</li>
            <li>2 medium sesame seed burger buns</li>
            <li>½ cup shredded iceberg lettuce</li>
            <li>2 thick slices tomato</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons diced onion</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon pickle slices</li>
            <li>1 teaspoons mustard</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons ketchup</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut potatoes in ½-inch wide strips. 
                Place in a large bowl filled with warm water 
                and soak for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Pour oil in a Dutch oven and heat over medium-high heat 
                until it reaches 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). 
                Line a rimmed baking sheet with paper towels 
                and set a wire rack on top.</li>
            <li>Drain potatoes well and dry thoroughly with paper towels. 
                Add ½ of the dried potatoes to the hot oil and cook, 
                stirring often, until they soften slightly, about 3 minutes. 
                Remove potatoes to the wire rack to drain. Repeat with remaining potatoes. 
                Maintain oil temperature at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) 
                for finishing fries just before serving.</li>
            <li>Divide ground chuck into 4 portions and 
                flatten to form ¼-inch thick patties.</li>
            <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. 
                Add burger patties to the hot skillet and 
                cook undisturbed, until a brown crust 
                has formed around the edges, 2 to 3 minutes. 
                Flip, press down with a spatula to flatten, and cook for 2 more minutes. 
                Flip again, press down once more, 
                then top each patty with a slice of cheese; 
                cook for 1 minute.</li>
            <li>While the burgers cook, spread mustard and 
                ketchup on bottom halves of the buns. 
                Drizzle hot sauce on the top halves of the buns, 
                then spread mayonnaise over top. 
                Layer with lettuce, tomato slices, 
                pickles, and onions.</li>
            <li>Invert 1 patty onto a second patty so the 
                cheese sides are touching. 
                Repeat with remaining 2 patties. 
                Place a stacked patty onto each top bun, 
                and cover with a bottom bun, condiment-side down. 
                Wrap burgers in foil.</li>
            <li>Return fries to the hot oil and cook until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. 
                Drain on paper towels and sprinkle with salt. 
                Serve immediately with burgers.</li>
        </ol>
